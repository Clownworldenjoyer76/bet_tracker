Decision Table (Version 1.2 — All-Time Data-Aligned)

This version incorporates all available soccer bets to date (01/22/26), using tight win-probability buckets derived from market odds.
Draws remain excluded from evaluation.

| Probability Bucket  | Extra Juice | Rationale                                                |
| ------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **p ≥ 0.65**        | +10         | Favorites show meaningful losses; not as safe as implied |
| **0.55 ≤ p < 0.65** | +5          | Generally stable, but variance exists                    |
| **0.50 ≤ p < 0.55** | +0          | Performing close to expectation                          |
| **0.45 ≤ p < 0.50** | +0          | Mixed but healthy; no consistent underperformance        |
| **0.40 ≤ p < 0.45** | **+5**      | Prior penalty overstated; mild caution only              |
| **0.30 ≤ p < 0.40** | **+25**     | Clear underperformance relative to implied probability   |
| **p < 0.30**        | **+75**     | Strong, repeated underperformance; tail risk confirmed   |



✅ Bet History Summary (All-Time)

Total soccer bets analyzed: 63
Bet type: Straight (win only)

Evaluation basis: Market implied win probability → empirical outcomes

Stakes, EV, and profit intentionally ignored for calibration purposes

✅ Key Takeaways 

Low-probability bets (<30%) are structurally weak → heavy juice justified

30–40% still underperforms, but materially better than deep tails

40–55% is the most stable zone → no juice required

High-probability favorites are not free → modest juice retained

Original Version 1.1 logic was directionally correct but too coarse
