Personal Juice Table (American odds add-on)

Probability Bucket | Extra Juice | Rationale
------------------ | ----------- | ----------------------------------------
p ≥ 0.75           | +30% edge   | Heavy favorites still underperform, but prior 50% was too punitive
0.70 ≤ p < 0.75    | +25% edge   | Consistent underperformance remains
0.65 ≤ p < 0.70    | +25% edge   | Worst-performing bucket by net profit
0.60 ≤ p < 0.65    | +15% edge   | Volatile, mixed results
0.55 ≤ p < 0.60    | +10% edge   | Best-performing range so far
0.50 ≤ p < 0.55    | +10% edge   | Neutral, small sample
0.45 ≤ p < 0.50    | +20% edge   | Testing zone
0.40 ≤ p < 0.45    | +30% edge   | Testing zone
0.35 ≤ p < 0.40    | +40% edge   | Testing zone
0.00 ≤ p < 0.35    | +75% edge   | Extreme longshots — protection required

• Heavy favorites require extreme protection.
• Mid-range probabilities (0.55–0.60) are currently the only clean zone.
• Table will be revised after additional sample size.
