Decision Table — NCAAB Juice (Version 1.2 — All-Time Data-Aligned)

This version incorporates all available NCAAB bets to date, using tight win-probability buckets derived from market odds.
Draws are not applicable to NCAAB and are excluded.

✅ Personal Juice Table — NCAAB (Proposed, v1.2)

| Probability Bucket  | Extra Juice (edge %) | Rationale                                                         |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **p ≥ 0.75**        | **+25%**             | Favorites win often but not dominantly; protection still required |
| **0.70 ≤ p < 0.75** | **+20%**             | Strong win rate, but variance and price sensitivity persist       |
| **0.65 ≤ p < 0.70** | **+15%**             | Solid performance; prior penalty overstated                       |
| **0.60 ≤ p < 0.65** | **+10%**             | Stable, high-volume range with manageable volatility              |
| **0.55 ≤ p < 0.60** | **+5%**              | Best-performing zone empirically; minimal friction                |
| **0.50 ≤ p < 0.55** | **+5%**              | Large sample, near-fair outcomes                                  |
| **0.45 ≤ p < 0.50** | **+15%**             | Mixed results; moderate caution                                   |
| **0.40 ≤ p < 0.45** | **+25%**             | Thin sample, downside skew                                        |
| **0.35 ≤ p < 0.40** | **+35%**             | Underperformance increases materially                             |
| **p < 0.35**        | **+75%**             | Tail risk confirmed; protection mandatory                         |

Additional Hard Constraints (unchanged)

Favorites may not flip past +120

p < 0.10 capped at +2500 (auto-filter zone)

✅ NCAAB Bet History — All-Time

Total bets: 361

Evaluation basis: Implied win probability → empirical outcomes

Stake size, EV, and profit ignored for calibration

✅ Bucketed Results (All-Time)

| Probability Bucket | Bets | Wins |
| ------------------ | ---- | ---- |
| **p < 0.35**       | 12   | 2    |
| **0.35–0.40**      | 5    | 1    |
| **0.40–0.45**      | 5    | 3    |
| **0.45–0.50**      | 8    | 6    |
| **0.50–0.55**      | 195  | 107  |
| **0.55–0.60**      | 35   | 19   |
| **0.60–0.65**      | 23   | 15   |
| **0.65–0.70**      | 29   | 24   |
| **0.70–0.75**      | 13   | 9    |
| **≥ 0.75**         | 8    | 5    |


(Aggregated from 3% bands.)

✅ Key Takeaways (Concise)

0.55–0.60 is the cleanest zone → lowest juice justified

0.50–0.55 is a stable anchor → treat as near-fair

0.60–0.70 performs well, but not enough to remove protection

Heavy favorites (≥ 0.70) win often but do not dominate → juice required, but less than originally assumed

p < 0.35 is structurally weak → keep extreme protection

✅ Status

Original v1.1 notes were directionally correct but too punitive

v1.2 juice is now:
monotonic
sample-aware
aligned with all-time outcomes

This version is suitable to freeze as NCAAB v1.2
