Decision Table — NBA Juice (Version 1.0 — All-Time Data-Aligned)

1. Moneyline: tighten the middle, be harsher on tails
What the data clearly says

From nba_data_ml_bands.csv and the split outputs:

p < 0.30 (≈ +300 and worse)
• ROI is consistently deeply negative
• Even when wins spike, variance is extreme
→ Your +60% juice is justified and possibly conservative

0.30–0.40 range (≈ +180 to +260)
• Mixed ROI, sharp swings
• Some isolated profitable bands, but not stable across home/away
→ Protection needed, but not nuclear

0.45–0.55 (≈ -110 to +110)
• True anchor zone
• ROI clusters near breakeven
• Home underdogs slightly outperform, away favorites slightly underperform
→ This is where your model is “right but blunt”

p ≥ 0.65 (≈ -180 and stronger)
• Win rates very high
• ROI still negative due to price
• Risk is overconfidence, not losses
→ Needs cap, not punishment

Suggested v1.1 NBA Moneyline Juice Table
Probability Bucket	Old Juice	Suggested Juice	Reason
p ≥ 0.70	+15%	+10%	Wins are real, but over-penalizing costs volume
0.60–0.70	+10%	+8%	Data supports mild protection only
0.55–0.60	+8%	+6%	Near-fair, slight favorite tax
0.50–0.55	+8%	+6%	True anchor; don’t distort
0.45–0.50	+10%	+8%	Small downside skew confirmed
0.40–0.45	+15%	+15%	Keep — volatility real
0.35–0.40	+20%	+25%	Empirical underperformance stronger than expected
0.30–0.35	+30%	+35%	Still poison-adjacent
p < 0.30	+60%	+60–70% (cap)	Data fully supports hard wall

Key tweak:
👉 Reduce juice slightly in the center, increase discrimination just below 40%.

2. Totals (O/U): asymmetric juice, not symmetric

Your example NBA totals file already tells the story:

Low totals (≤ 205)
• Overs massively outperform
• Unders get crushed

Mid totals (215–235)
• Near efficient
• Slight under bias

High totals (≥ 245)
• Sample small
• Market still misprices pace inflation

Recommendation

Do not mirror over/under juice. Treat them separately.

Example NBA Totals Juice Logic

Low total:

Over: +0–3%

Under: +10–15%

Mid total:

Both sides: +4–6%

High total:

Over: +8–10%

Under: +4–6%

This aligns with your own totals ROI, where unders are the structural leak, not overs.

3. Spreads: venue-aware, favorite-aware

From nba_spread_bands.csv:

Small spreads (0–3):

Home underdogs outperform

Away favorites underperform

Mid spreads (3.5–7):

Market close to efficient

Large spreads (10+):

Favorites bleed slowly

Underdogs survive better than expected

Practical adjustment

Instead of a single spread juice:

Add +5–10% extra juice to:

Away favorites

Large-spread favorites

Reduce juice slightly for:

Home underdogs at ≤ 3 points

This is consistent across NBA only — do not generalize to NHL/NFL.

4. Structural recommendation for your flow

You are now at the point where the correct architecture is:

Market odds → implied probability

Bucket → base juice (league + bet type)

Modifiers

venue

favorite/underdog

extreme bands

Final personal line

Only then apply stake logic

Your current table is already step (2).
The data you’ve generated enables step (3) without guesswork.
