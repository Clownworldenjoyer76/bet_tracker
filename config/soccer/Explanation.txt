A band is simply a range of win probabilities.

For example:
	•	0.20–0.25 band = outcomes priced around 20–25% win probability
	•	0.60–0.65 band = outcomes priced around 60–65%

It’s just grouping bets by similar probability so you can measure how they actually performed and adjust juice accordingly.

Extra juice means the extra safety cushion you add to your win probability before you decide to bet.

It represents how much outcomes in that probability range have historically underperformed.

juice:
If bets in the 25% range actually only win 20% of the time, the extra juice is 5%.
So when your model says 25%, you treat it like 20% before pricing the bet.

In simple terms:

Extra juice = how much you downgrade your probability to stay safe.

Good. Let’s make this very simple.

You already have:
	•	p_model → your model’s win probability
	•	extra_juice → the safety adjustment from the band
	•	Sportsbook decimal odds

Here is exactly how you implement it.

⸻

Step 1 — Get Your Model Probability

Example:

p_model = 0.27


⸻

Step 2 — Find the Band

If your config says:

0.25–0.30 band
extra_juice = 0.03

That means outcomes in this range historically underperform by 3%.

⸻

Step 3 — Adjust the Probability

Subtract the extra juice:

p_adjusted = p_model - extra_juice

So:

p_adjusted = 0.27 - 0.03 = 0.24

You now treat this as a 24% bet, not 27%.

⸻

Step 4 — Convert to Acceptable Odds

acceptable_decimal = 1 / p_adjusted

So:

1 / 0.24 = 4.17

That means:

You only bet if the sportsbook offers odds higher than 4.17.

⸻

Step 5 — Compare to Market

If sportsbook offers:

4.40 → BET
3.90 → NO BET


⸻

That’s It

You are not modifying the sportsbook odds.

You are modifying your required probability threshold before betting.

⸻

In one sentence:

Extra juice lowers your probability before you convert it to acceptable odds.
