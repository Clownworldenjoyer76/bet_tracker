A band is simply a range of win probabilities.

For example:
	•	0.20–0.25 band = outcomes priced around 20–25% win probability
	•	0.60–0.65 band = outcomes priced around 60–65%

It’s just grouping bets by similar probability so you can measure how they actually performed and adjust juice accordingly.
