A band is simply a range of win probabilities.

For example:
	•	0.20–0.25 band = outcomes priced around 20–25% win probability
	•	0.60–0.65 band = outcomes priced around 60–65%

It’s just grouping bets by similar probability so you can measure how they actually performed and adjust juice accordingly.

Extra juice means the extra safety cushion you add to your win probability before you decide to bet.

It represents how much outcomes in that probability range have historically underperformed.

juice:
If bets in the 25% range actually only win 20% of the time, the extra juice is 5%.
So when your model says 25%, you treat it like 20% before pricing the bet.

In simple terms:

Extra juice = how much you downgrade your probability to stay safe.
