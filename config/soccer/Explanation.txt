A band is simply a range of win probabilities.

For example:
	•	0.20–0.25 band = outcomes priced around 20–25% win probability
	•	0.60–0.65 band = outcomes priced around 60–65%

It’s just grouping bets by similar probability so you can measure how they actually performed and adjust juice accordingly.

Extra juice means the extra safety cushion you add to your win probability before you decide to bet.

It represents how much outcomes in that probability range have historically underperformed.

juice:
If bets in the 25% range actually only win 20% of the time, the extra juice is 5%.
So when your model says 25%, you treat it like 20% before pricing the bet.

In simple terms:

Extra juice = how much you downgrade your probability to stay safe.

Good. Let’s make this very simple.

You already have:
	•	p_model → your model’s win probability
	•	extra_juice → the safety adjustment from the band
	•	Sportsbook decimal odds

Here is exactly how you implement it.

⸻

Step 1 — Get Your Model Probability

Example:

p_model = 0.27


⸻

Step 2 — Find the Band

If your config says:

0.25–0.30 band
extra_juice = 0.03

That means outcomes in this range historically underperform by 3%.

⸻

Step 3 — Adjust the Probability

Subtract the extra juice:

p_adjusted = p_model - extra_juice

So:

p_adjusted = 0.27 - 0.03 = 0.24

You now treat this as a 24% bet, not 27%.

⸻

Step 4 — Convert to Acceptable Odds

acceptable_decimal = 1 / p_adjusted

So:

1 / 0.24 = 4.17

That means:

You only bet if the sportsbook offers odds higher than 4.17.

⸻

Step 5 — Compare to Market

If sportsbook offers:

4.40 → BET
3.90 → NO BET


⸻

That’s It

You are not modifying the sportsbook odds.

You are modifying your required probability threshold before betting.

⸻

In one sentence:

Extra juice lowers your probability before you convert it to acceptable odds.

⸻

______________
Good. Let’s apply this directly to your real input.

You have:

Win: 73.7%
Draw: 10.7%
Away: 15.6%

Convert to decimals:

p_home = 0.737
p_draw = 0.107
p_away = 0.156


⸻

Step 1 — Find the Band

For home:

p_home = 0.737

That falls into the 0.70–0.75 band (for example).

Assume your config says:

side = home
band = 0.70–0.75
extra_juice = 0.02


⸻

Step 2 — Adjust Probability

Subtract the extra juice:

p_home_adjusted = 0.737 - 0.02
                 = 0.717

You now treat Newcastle as a 71.7% team — not 73.7%.

⸻

Step 3 — Convert to Acceptable Odds

acceptable_decimal = 1 / 0.717
                   = 1.39

That means:

You only bet Newcastle if the sportsbook offers greater than 1.39.

⸻

Same Logic For Draw

If draw band says:

extra_juice = 0.04

Then:

p_draw_adjusted = 0.107 - 0.04 = 0.067
acceptable_decimal = 1 / 0.067 = 14.93

You now demand 14.93 before betting draw.

⸻

The Entire Logic In One Block

For each outcome:

1. Take model probability
2. Look up band
3. Subtract extra_juice
4. acceptable_odds = 1 / adjusted_probability
5. Bet only if sportsbook_odds > acceptable_odds

That is it.

⸻

You are not modifying the sportsbook price.
You are raising your required threshold.

⸻

If you want, I can now show you:

• Why subtraction is correct (and when to add instead)
• Or how to integrate this cleanly into your existing edge pipeline
