You already built the hard part:
historical fair probability → realized win rate → calibrated extra juice by band.

Now the correct production approach is this:

---

# ✅ Step 1 — Start With Your Fair Probability

For each side (home / draw / away):

```
p_fair = your_model_probability
```

This must sum to 1 across the 3 outcomes.

---

# ✅ Step 2 — Apply Historical Extra Juice (From Your Curve)

1. Find the correct probability band.
2. Pull `extra_juice` from:

```
config/soccer/bundesliga_1x2_juice.csv
```

Then:

```
p_adjusted = p_fair + extra_juice
```

Clip between 0 and 1.

This corrects for:

* Longshot bias
* Favorite bias
* League-specific mispricing

---

# ✅ Step 3 — Convert to Personally Acceptable Odds

```
acceptable_decimal = 1 / p_adjusted
```

Then convert to American.

That becomes your **minimum required sportsbook price**.

---

# ✅ Step 4 — Compare to Sportsbook

From your clean feed:

Example:

```
Inter Milan −145
```

Convert to decimal:

```
1.6897
```

If:

```
sportsbook_decimal > acceptable_decimal
```

→ Bet.

---

# ⚠ Critical: Re-Normalize

Because you're adjusting each side separately:

After applying extra juice:

```
p_home_adj
p_draw_adj
p_away_adj
```

Re-normalize:

```
p_adj = p_adj / (sum of all three)
```

Otherwise you distort the book.

# 🔥 Best Production Structure

For each match:

1. Pull your model probs
2. Apply side-specific extra juice
3. Re-normalize
4. Convert to acceptable odds
5. Compare to sportsbook
6. Bet only if:

   * Edge > threshold (ex: 2–3%)
   * Meets liquidity rule
   * Meets max exposure rule

---

# 🧠 What Not To Do

Do NOT:

* Add fixed juice to all probabilities
* Use flat % adjustments
* Ignore side asymmetry
* Skip re-normalization

That destroys calibration.

---

# 🎯 Bottom Line

The best approach is:

**Fair model → league/side band adjustment → re-normalize → convert → compare**
